all about bankole isaac
There are several forms of expressions, but fashion is one i learnt and developed at a very young age, and since then its become my life work. i understood this fashion as a means of expression and appreciating the beauty of life and the universe and im lucky to have found success in my vocation.

This model portfolio is inspired by the extra-ordinary. by the colors provided and created by mother earth and its constituents. i follow trends and apply them to my work, always trying to beat the usual and make it standout. interested in collaborating on a future project? Lets be in touch.
